# apis-talk

This is a repository for storing Jupyter notebooks that provide basic "hello world" type examples of data science APIs which I've tried out.  Depending on how many Stars this repository gets, I will continue to update it with new things that I try.

This repo started as a place to store examples to accompany my talk at the Dallas Data Science Conference 2017.

I would gladly accept pull requests from anyone who wants to contribute a short, reproducible, Jupyter notebook that demonstrates an appropriate API.
